Special file handling
---------------------
audio files
    offer to compare while ignoring tag data
    do a similarity match instead of exact match
    consider audio encoding quality to prioritize
    show tag info so the user can keep the one with 'better' tags
image files
    offer to compare while ignoring scale, rotation, color
    show image preview
video
    offer a fuzzy compare to detect if a video is the same, except for logo
    detect if a file is a clip of another file
ISO files (maybe other disk image formats?)
    compare files inside the image with files outside of the image
file archives (tar, gzip, bzip2, unrar, possibly others..)
    offer to compare files inside the archive with files outside
cruft files -- offer to delete miscellaneous junk files
    stale vim and emacs backup files and swap files (check if needed somehow)
    object files
    core dumps
    stale lock/pid files
    dangling links
    browser cache files
    any thing else I can think of, look for a decruft script and steal ideas
pacman packages
    offer to keep 1 or 2 versions behind the currently installed version
    handle pacsave files
source code repositories
    not sure if this is possible, but offer to delete locally stored
    repositories if current with the remote end. maybe try a git pull
    or equivalent and if nothing happens, then assume it's up-to-date?
